# ChatApplication

This app just has one2one chat feature, I made it to learn firebase and to get exposure with chat application. 
So it's just a basic application with java and firebase realtime database

You need to create account in firebase and then need to create your app project name, create database, you can refer or import my
my json file for firebase database structure, i know it might not good practice to keep your database public but for learning purpose
we can skip and later we can add security using firebase auth library.

### It also shows if user is online/offline[last seen status]

### Prerequisite:-

1. Java
2. Firebase [Real time database and Storage][Signup with your Gmail]
3. XML
4. google-services.json [Download it from your firebase project and add it to your android studio app modules]
5. You need to Add project to firebase console (your app id, SHA1 key, etc)
6. chatapp-db.json [Just to get the reference how your firebase no-sql database would look like once you use this app]
